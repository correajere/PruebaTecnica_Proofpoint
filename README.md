A- 
1. Describe the most relevant learnings from programming-related subjects.
From my perspective, the most relevant learnings from programming-related subjects include:

Code and Structure: Understanding design patterns to write clean and robust code, and learning about software architecture to define the foundation of a project from requirements elicitation to deployment.
Programming Paradigms: Gaining experience with object-oriented programming (OOP) at work and functional programming in university projects.
Collaboration and Methodologies: Working in teams using agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, and tools like Jira and Trello.
Technical Skills: Debugging and testing code to ensure functionality, and staying adaptable to learn new languages, frameworks, and tools as technology evolves.

2. Describe a situation you had to resolve with a classmate from a study or work group.
Recently, in a project at work, I was responsible for implementing invoice queries. We had agreed on a color palette and other design elements for the new feature. However, the designer changed the palette without consulting the team and sent prototypes to the client. This created a problem, as I had to adapt the front-end again. To resolve this, I spoke with the designer and my team leader, emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement before making changes or communicating with the client. We discussed the issue with the client and agreed to keep the original design. This situation taught me the importance of clear communication and involving all stakeholders in decisions.

3. Describe your personal learning plans or development expectations in technical areas.
My main goal is to finish my degree in Information Systems Engineering, which I am currently in my fifth year of. I also plan to deepen my knowledge of .NET and Angular and explore data science. I am currently taking a DevOps course to understand the entire development process better. In the future, I aim to master advanced programming concepts like algorithms, data structures, and design patterns. Additionally, I would like to gain enough experience to lead a team or an area.



B- Ejercicio Práctico a resolver:

The Library's Lost Books

Imagine you're helping a library that's recently digitized its collection.
Unfortunately, the digital catalog has become corrupted, and some book records are missing crucial information.
You have a list of books but some entries are incomplete or have errors.
Your task is to organize and fix the library's digital catalog.
You'll receive a CSV file with a list of book entries.
Each entry should contain three fields comma-separated, with book information: Title, Author, Publication Year
Some entries are completely valid. However, others might have issues like:

The book's title (which should always be present).
The author's name (which might be missing).
Missing or invalid publication years (e.g., negative years, or years far in the future, or string instead of number, etc).
Duplicate entries for the same book.
Your goal is to:

Create a well-organized structure to store this book information.
Identify and correct entries with missing or invalid data.
For missing authors, mark the book as “Author Unknown”.
For invalid publication years, use a default value like 0.
Remove duplicate entries, keeping only one valid record for each unique book.
Finally, present a clean, organized list of the corrected book entries.
Information grouped by author (if available) or by publication year (if author is unknown) is a plus.
Add anything that you consider of additional value
